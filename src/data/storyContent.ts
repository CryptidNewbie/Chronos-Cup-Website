When he stumbles into The Chronos Cup—an old brick sanctuary—he uncovers a profound sensory ability, his Siphon, and a secret war against the modern rush. Now, faced with a devastating external attack, Julian must choose a master: Kai's ruthless structure, Alistair's intoxicating chaos, or Salvatore's gentle balance. His choice will define his art, his power, and the love that anchors him against the storm.",
